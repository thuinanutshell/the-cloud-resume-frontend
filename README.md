# The Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS)

- [x] Your resume needs to be written in HTML. Not a Word doc, not a PDF. Here is an example of what I mean.
- [x] Your resume needs to be styled with CSS. No worries if you’re not a designer – neither am I. It doesn’t have to be fancy. But we need to see something other than raw HTML when we open the webpage.
- [x] Your HTML resume should be deployed online as an Amazon S3 static website. Services like Netlify and GitHub Pages are great and I would normally recommend them for personal static site deployments, but they make things a little too abstract for our purposes here. Use S3.
- [x] The S3 website URL should use HTTPS for security. You will need to use Amazon CloudFront to help with this.
