# The Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS)

# Fundamental Concepts
## Cloud Computing
- CC is a solution to the problem of the past, where companies hosted and maintained hardware like compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers, which required an entire infrastructure department. Because the cost of maintaining a large physical space is expensive and inflexible, cloud computing was born.
- CC is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. AWS owns and maintains the data centers and provides a **virtualized data center** tech and services to users over the Internet.
- Oftentimes, when you save your data to the cloud (backup), so that when your laptop breaks, your data is still saved somewhere safe.
- Availability Zone (AZs): clusters of data centers linked (high-speed and low-latency links) with one another
- Region: clusters of AZs
  - Compliance
  - Latency (how close is the IT resource to the user base?)
  - Pricing 
  - Service availability
- Edge locations that cache frequently accessed content
